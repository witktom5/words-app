# Words App

## Overview

This is my first React App. It is a simple quiz with random words from [Random Words API](https://github.com/mcnaveen/Random-Words-API). It takes 4 random words and their definitions from API and makes one of the definitions a question. I used Bootstrap 5 with a tiny bit of Sass. I also used [framer-motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion) for some little animations and [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons)
