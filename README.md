# Words App

[Live](https://sensational-haupia-506264.netlify.app/)

## Overview

This is my first React App. It is a simple quiz with random words from [Random Words API](https://github.com/mcnaveen/Random-Words-API). It takes 4 random words and their definitions from API and makes one of the words' definition a question. I used Bootstrap 5 with a tiny bit of Sass. I also used [framer-motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion) for some little animations and [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons).

It is pretty colorful, there is a subtle gradient animation in the background. Correct answers in the quiz grant points. It has "streak" functionality - if you give two correct answers consecutively, you will gain more points for your next correct answer. You lose after 3 wrong answers.

Can be improved by using more complex API, so word categories and difficulty levels could be added. There could also be a high score system. Overall there is a lot to potentially implement in this small app.
